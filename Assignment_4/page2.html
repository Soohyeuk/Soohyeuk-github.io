        <p id="dil1-content">The games shown above are the games that you cannot buy from the official retailers anymore. And it is 
            just a tip of the iceberg!
            They are definitely available for pre-owned in a game shop, but often exceeds the normal price range. 
            For example, the Pokemon game above tend to be around $90+, and have numerous fake versions. 
            It also does not benefit the official creator by buying it and some companies tend to dislike it (reason why Xbox discontinued pre-owned games previously).

        <p id="dil1-content"> 
            Some games are available on their modern consoles to play. This is great for sure! 
            However, because of license issues, or more complicated reasons, they can be taken down at any moment, which 
            definitely is not something you'd want if you have bunch of games to try out...

            Many gamers would love to try retro games and feel the classic vibes, or enjoy the strong nostalgic part of a culture. 
            With this dilemma in our society though... it is looking like a rough rail. You can find more games that are inaccessible
